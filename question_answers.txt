	A rocket ship taking off with the message "The install worked successfully! Congratulations! 
	You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs."

	At page / I saw a 404 error with the message "Using the URLconf defined in mysite.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, 
	in this order:
    		polls/
    		admin/
	The empty path didn't match any of these."
	
	At page polls/ I saw the message "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."

	Migrations update the database schema to include new models
5.
	I see a panel in which I can manage models as well as groups and users. It looks like I can add items to the database here as well as
	potentially change the schema.
