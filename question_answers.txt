	A rocket ship taking off with the message "The install worked successfully! Congratulations! 
	You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs."
3.
	At page / I saw a 404 error with the message "Using the URLconf defined in mysite.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, 
	in this order:
    		polls/
    		admin/
	The empty path didn't match any of these."
	
	At page polls/ I saw the message "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."

	Migrations update the database schema to include new models
5.
	I see a panel in which I can manage models as well as groups and users. It looks like I can add items to the database here as well as
	potentially change the schema.

	When entering /polls/38 I get the response "You're looking at question 38", /polls/38/results gives the response "You're looking at the results of question 38."
	and /polls/38/vote gives the response "You're voting on question 38.". When entering a string such as /polls/hello I am given a 404 response.

	Hardcoding the url could lead to errors in the future and makes the application less scaleable.
8.
	Faster to get a site running if you are willing to use the generic views and you don't have to write as much boiler plate. Also you don't need to know as much
	about what Django is doing under the hood as it handles various views for you. Using your own views allows for greater flexibility and customization.
